Macify is a Mac Menu Bar app to easily allow for the viewing of your currently playing song on Spotify, as well as changing the song. To use the playback control features (ie. play/pause, forward, backward) you must have Spotify premium. The app can control your Spotify music while it is playing anywhere, not just on the Mac with the app installed.

### TODO:
* Add progress bar, so the position of the song can be controlled
* Add an icon to display in the menu bar
* Fix bug regarding forward/backward buttons not getting the correct current track when playing off another device.
